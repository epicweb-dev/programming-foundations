# Template Literals

👨‍💼 Remember how tedious string concatenation was? Template literals make
combining strings and expressions much easier!

Instead of quotes, template literals use **backticks**:

```ts
console.log(`Hello, World!`)
```

What makes these so special is you don't have to escape quotes or even
newline characters:

```ts
console.log(`Hello,
World!`)

// Prints the same thing as: console.log('Hello,\nWorld!')
```

In addition, while you can still use string concatenation, you can embed any expression using `${expression}`:

```ts
console.log(`2 + 2 = ${2 + 2}`) // Prints: 2 + 2 = 4
console.log(`Hello, ${'World'}!`) // Prints: Hello, World!
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and complete the following tasks:

1. Log a template literal that says "The answer is 42" using `${40 + 2}`
2. Log a greeting that includes "Hello" and "TypeScript" in one template literal
3. Log a math problem and its answer, like "10 times 5 equals 50"

💰 The backtick key is usually in the top-left of your keyboard, below Escape.
