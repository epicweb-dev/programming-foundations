# Number Expressions

👨‍💼 Numbers are essential for any kind of calculation. Let's explore arithmetic
in JavaScript.

JavaScript supports all the standard math operators:

- `+` addition
- `-` subtraction
- `*` multiplication
- `/` division

```ts
console.log(10 + 5) // 15
console.log(10 - 3) // 7
console.log(4 * 3) // 12
console.log(20 / 4) // 5
```

📜 There are many more operators in JavaScript beyond these basics! You can find
a complete list in the
[MDN Expressions and Operators guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators).

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and complete the following tasks:

1. Log the result of adding 25 and 17
2. Log the result of multiplying 8 by 6
3. Log the result of dividing 100 by 4
4. Log the result of a more complex expression: `(10 + 5) * 2`

💰 You can use parentheses to control the order of operations, just like in
regular math!
