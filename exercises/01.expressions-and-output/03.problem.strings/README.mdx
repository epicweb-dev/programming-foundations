# String Expressions

👨‍💼 Strings are one of the most common types of data in programming. Let's
explore what you can do with them.

You can combine strings together using the `+` operator. This is called
**concatenation**:

```ts
console.log('Hello' + ' ' + 'World') // Prints: Hello World
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and complete the following tasks:

1. Log the result of concatenating `"Hello"` and `"TypeScript"` with a space
   between them
2. Log your first name and last name concatenated together
3. Log a longer message by concatenating multiple strings

💰 Remember to include spaces where you need them - the `+` operator joins
strings exactly as they are!

	If you're using an AI editor, the editor might try to avoid the extra `+`
	because you can write this more easily without it.
