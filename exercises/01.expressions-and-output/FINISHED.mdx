# Expressions and Output

👨‍💼 Great work! You've learned the fundamentals of working with code.

You learned:

- 🖨️ **console.log()** prints values to the terminal so you can see results
- 🏃 **Running code** with `node index.ts` executes your TypeScript file
- 📝 **String expressions** create text values using quotes
- ➕ **String concatenation** joins strings together with `+`
- 🔢 **Number expressions** and arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- 💬 **Template literals** use backticks and `${expression}` for interpolation

🦉 Key insight: Everything in programming is about **expressions** that produce
**values**. Understanding this mental model will help you as you learn more
complex concepts.
