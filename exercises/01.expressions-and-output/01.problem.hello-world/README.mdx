# Hello World

👨‍💼 Every programmer starts here: printing "Hello, World!" to the screen.

The `console.log()` function takes a value and prints it to the terminal. This
is how you see the results of your code.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and complete the following tasks:

1. Use `console.log()` to print the string `"Hello, World!"`
2. Use `console.log()` to print your name as a string

💰 Strings are text values wrapped in quotes:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
console.log('This is a string')
console.log("Double quotes work too")
```

<callout-info>Which quotes you use is a matter of preference.</callout-info>

🐨 Once you've completed the exercise, run `node index.ts` in the playground to
see your output!
