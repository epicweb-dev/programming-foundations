# Hello World

👨‍💼 Every programmer starts here: printing "Hello, World!" to the screen.

The `console.log()` function takes a value and prints it to the terminal. This
is how you see the results of your code.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and complete the following tasks:

1. Use `console.log()` to print the string `"Hello, World!"`
2. Use `console.log()` to print your name as a string

💰 Strings are text values wrapped in quotes (single or double).

<callout-info>
	Which quotes you use is a matter of preference, but I typically use single
	quotes. A **code formatter** is a tool that automatically formats your code to
	follow consistent style rules. If you have one installed (like
	[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)), it may automatically change your quotes
	when you save the file. For example, it might convert double quotes to single
	quotes. That's okay! The output stays the same either way.

🐨 Once you've completed the exercise, run `node index.ts` in the playground to
see your output!
