# Expressions and Output

The first thing any programmer needs to learn is how to see the results of their
code. In JavaScript and TypeScript, we use `console.log()` to print values to
the terminal.

```ts
console.log('Hello, World!')
```

When you run this code in any JavaScript environment (like the browser console or in Node.js), you'll see `Hello, World!` printed in your terminal.

## Running Your Code

You can save this code in a file and then run it with Node like so:

```bash
node index.ts
```

Node.js will execute your code and show any `console.log` output in the
terminal.

## Expressions

An **expression** is any piece of code that produces a value. Here are some
examples:

```ts
// String expressions
'Hello'
'Hello' + ' World'

// Number expressions
42
10 + 5
100 / 4
```

You can pass any expression to `console.log()` to see its value:

```ts
console.log(10 + 5) // Prints: 15
console.log('Hello' + ' World') // Prints: Hello World
```

	`console.log()` is your best friend when learning to code. Use it liberally to
	understand what your code is doing!

In this exercise, you'll learn to use `console.log()` to output different types
of expressions.

## JSON.stringify

Some tests in this workshop read structured values from the terminal output.
To do that, we use `JSON.stringify(...)` to convert objects into strings that
can be printed and parsed reliably.

```ts
const result = { greeting: 'Hello', count: 3 }
console.log('Results JSON:', JSON.stringify(result))
```

`JSON.stringify` turns JavaScript values into a JSON string so the test can
compare exact results.
