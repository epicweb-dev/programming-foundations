# Escaping Strings

👨‍💼 Nice work! You've learned how to escape special characters in strings.

🦉 Escaping can get tedious if you have lots of special characters. The good
news is that there's another way to create strings which we'll cover soon:
**template literals** (using backticks). They make many of these escaping issues
disappear and even let you write actual multi-line strings without `\n`!
