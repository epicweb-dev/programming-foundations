# Template Literals

👨‍💼 Excellent! Template literals are one of the most useful features in
JavaScript.

🦉 Template literals are especially powerful because you can put **any
expression** inside `${}` - not just simple values. You'll use them constantly
as you write more code.

```ts
// You can even call functions inside template literals
console.log(`Random number: ${Math.random()}`)
```

We'll get to functions later.
