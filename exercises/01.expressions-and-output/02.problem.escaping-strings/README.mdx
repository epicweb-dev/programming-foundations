# Escaping Strings

👨‍💼 Sometimes you need to include special characters inside your strings. What
happens if you want to include a quote character inside a string that's wrapped
in quotes?

If you use single quotes, you need to **escape** single quotes inside the string
using a backslash (`\`):

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
console.log('It\'s great')  // Prints: It's great
```

And if you use double quotes, you need to escape double quotes inside the string:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
console.log("He said \"Hello\"")  // Prints: He said "Hello"
```

## Special Characters

The backslash also lets you include other special characters that you can't
easily type:

| Escape Sequence | Character    |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| `\n`            | Newline      |
| `\t`            | Tab          |
| `\\`            | Backslash    |
| `\'`            | Single quote |
| `\"`            | Double quote |

```ts
console.log('Line 1\nLine 2') // Prints on two lines
console.log('Name:\tKody') // Prints with a tab between
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and complete the following tasks:

1. Log a string using single quotes that contains an apostrophe (like "It's
   working!")
2. Log a string using double quotes that contains a quoted phrase (like: She
   said "Hi")
3. Log "Hello" and "World" on separate lines using `\n` in a single string
4. Log tab-separated column headers: "Name:" "Age:" "City:" using `\t`

💰 Remember: use `\'` to escape single quotes, `\"` to escape double quotes,
`\n` for newlines, and `\t` for tabs!
