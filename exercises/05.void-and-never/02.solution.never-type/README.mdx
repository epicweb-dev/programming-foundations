# The Never Type

👨‍💼 You've mastered one of TypeScript's most powerful features!

🦉 The exhaustiveness pattern is incredibly useful. If someone adds a new status
like `'cancelled'` to the union type, TypeScript will error at the default case:

```ts
type Status = 'pending' | 'success' | 'error' | 'cancelled'

// Now TypeScript errors:
// Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'never'
const _exhaustive: never = status // status could be 'cancelled'
```

This forces you to handle the new case—you can't forget!

This pattern catches bugs at compile time that would otherwise be runtime
surprises. It's especially valuable when:

- Working with state machines
- Handling action types (like Redux)
- Processing API responses with different shapes
