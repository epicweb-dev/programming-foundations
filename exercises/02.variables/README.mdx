# Variables and Immutability

Variables are containers for values. In TypeScript (and modern JavaScript), you
have two main ways to declare them: `let` and `const`.

```ts
let count = 0 // Can be reassigned
const name = 'Alice' // Cannot be reassigned
```

## When to Use Each

**Use `const` by default.** It signals that this binding won't change, making
your code easier to understand.

**Use `let` when you need to reassign.** Loop counters, accumulators, and state
that changes over time.

```ts
const TAX_RATE = 0.08 // Never changes
let total = 0 // Will be updated

for (const item of items) {
	total += item.price // Reassigning total
}
```

## Reassignment vs Mutation

An important distinction:

- **Reassignment** - Pointing the variable to a new value
- **Mutation** - Changing the contents of the existing value

```ts
let arr = [1, 2, 3]
arr = [4, 5, 6] // Reassignment - arr points to a NEW array
arr.push(7) // Mutation - modifying the SAME array
```

<callout-warning>
	`const` prevents reassignment but NOT mutation. You can still modify the
	contents of a `const` array or object.
</callout-warning>

Understanding this distinction helps you write predictable, bug-free code.

<callout-info>
	You might encounter `var` in older JavaScript code. It's the original way to
	declare variables, but it has confusing scoping rules (function scope instead
	of block scope) and allows redeclaration. Modern JavaScript introduced `let`
	and `const` specifically to fix these issues. There's no reason to use `var`
	in new code, which is why we focus exclusively on `let` and `const`.

## Exporting Variables

In this and future exercises, you'll be required to see the `export`
variables. This makes the variable available to other files. It's how the app
displays your values and how tests verify your solutions. For now, just know
that `export` shares your variable with the outside world.

Example of exporting a single variable:

```ts
export const FAVORITE_COLOR = 'blue'
```

Example of exporting multiple variables:

```ts
const FAVORITE_COLOR = 'blue'
let currentAge = 25

export { FAVORITE_COLOR, currentAge }
```

We'll cover modules in depth later in the workshop series.
