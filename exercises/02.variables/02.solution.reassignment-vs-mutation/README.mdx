# Reassignment vs Mutation

👨‍💼 You've discovered an important truth about `const`!

When you write `const arr = [1, 2, 3]`:

- The variable `arr` will always point to this specific array
- But the array itself can be modified

This is like having a permanent address (const) to a house where the furniture
can be rearranged (mutation).

🦉 If you want truly immutable data in TypeScript, you can use:

- `as const` for literal values
- `readonly` arrays: `ReadonlyArray<string>`
- Libraries like Immer for complex immutability

But for now, just remember: `const` = "I won't reassign this variable" not "this
value can never change."
