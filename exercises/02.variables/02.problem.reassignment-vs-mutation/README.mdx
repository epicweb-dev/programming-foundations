# Reassignment vs Mutation

👨‍💼 There's a subtle but important distinction between **reassignment** and
**mutation**. Understanding this prevents bugs that are hard to track down.

**Reassignment**: Pointing a variable to a completely new value

```ts
let x = 1
x = 2 // x now points to a new value
```

**Mutation**: Modifying the contents of an existing value

```ts
const obj = { count: 1 }
obj.count = 2 // The object itself is modified (mutated)
```

<callout-warning>
	`const` prevents reassignment but NOT mutation! You can still change
	properties on a `const` object.
</callout-warning>

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Try to reassign the `const` object (see the error)
2. Mutate the `const` object by changing its properties
3. Observe that mutation works even with `const`

💰 Common object mutations:

```ts
obj.property = newValue // Change a property
obj.newProp = value // Add a new property
```
