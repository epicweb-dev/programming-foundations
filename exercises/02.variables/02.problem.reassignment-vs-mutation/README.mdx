# Reassignment vs Mutation

👨‍💼 There's a subtle but important distinction between **reassignment** and
**mutation**. Understanding this prevents bugs that are hard to track down.

**Reassignment**: Pointing a variable to a completely new value

```ts
let x = 1
x = 2 // x now points to a new value
```

**Mutation**: Modifying the contents of an existing value

```ts
const arr = [1, 2, 3]
arr.push(4) // The array itself is modified (mutated)
```

<callout-warning>
	`const` prevents reassignment but NOT mutation! You can still push to a
	`const` array or add properties to a `const` object.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Try to reassign the `const` array (see the error)
2. Mutate the `const` array by adding an item
3. Observe that mutation works even with `const`

💰 Common array mutations:

```ts
arr.push(item) // Add to end
arr.pop() // Remove from end
arr[0] = newValue // Replace at index
```

🐨 Once you've completed the exercise, run `node index.ts` in the playground to test your work!
