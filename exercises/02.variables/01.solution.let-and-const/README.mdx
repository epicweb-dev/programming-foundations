# Let and Const

👨‍💼 Perfect! You've seen the difference between `let` and `const` in action.

When you tried to reassign `TAX_RATE`, TypeScript caught it immediately:

```
Cannot assign to 'TAX_RATE' because it is a constant.
```

This is exactly what we want! The tax rate shouldn't change during the program's
execution, and `const` enforces that.

🦉 Notice how `cartTotal` needed to be `let` because we updated it multiple
times. The pattern of accumulating a total is a classic use case for `let`.
