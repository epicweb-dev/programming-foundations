# Let and Const

👨‍💼 We're building a shopping cart system. Some values will change as users
interact (like the cart total), while others stay constant (like tax rates).

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a `const` for `TAX_RATE` set to `0.08`
2. Create a `let` for `cartTotal` starting at `0`
3. Add items to the cart by updating `cartTotal`
4. Try to reassign `TAX_RATE` and see what TypeScript says

💰 By convention, constants that represent fixed values are often UPPER_CASE:

```ts
const MAX_ITEMS = 100
const API_URL = 'https://api.example.com'
```

<callout-info>
	You might notice JavaScript sometimes produces surprising decimal results like
	`0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004`. This is due to how computers store decimal
	numbers in binary (floating point representation). It happens in most
	programming languages, not just JavaScript. For currency calculations in real
	apps, consider working in cents (integers) or using specialized libraries.
