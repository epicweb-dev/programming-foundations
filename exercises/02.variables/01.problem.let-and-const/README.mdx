# Let and Const

👨‍💼 We're building a shopping cart system. Some values will change as users
interact (like the cart total), while others stay constant (like tax rates).

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a `const` for `TAX_RATE` set to `0.08`
2. Create a `let` for `cartTotal` starting at `0`
3. Add items to the cart by updating `cartTotal`
4. Try to reassign `TAX_RATE` and see what TypeScript says

💰 By convention, constants that represent fixed values are often UPPER_CASE:

```ts
const MAX_ITEMS = 100
const API_URL = 'https://api.example.com'
```
