# Variables and Immutability

👨‍💼 Great job understanding the difference between `let` and `const`!

Key takeaways:

- 🔒 **`const`** prevents reassignment—use it by default
- 🔄 **`let`** allows reassignment—use for values that change
- ⚠️ **`const` doesn't prevent mutation**—objects and arrays can still be
  modified

🦉 A good rule of thumb: Start with `const`. If you find you need to reassign,
change it to `let`. This makes your intentions clear to anyone reading your
code.

The distinction between reassignment and mutation becomes even more important
when working with objects and arrays, which we'll cover in the next workshop.
