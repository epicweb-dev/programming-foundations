# Conditionals

👨‍💼 Nice work! You've built a grade calculator with branching logic.

🦉 Notice how the `else if` chain works: once a condition is true, the rest are
skipped. That's why we can write `score >= 80` for B—we already know it's not
>= 90 because that check came first.

An alternative approach uses **early returns** in functions (we'll cover this
soon):

```ts
function getGrade(score: number): string {
	if (score >= 90) return 'A'
	if (score >= 80) return 'B'
	if (score >= 70) return 'C'
	if (score >= 60) return 'D'
	return 'F'
}
```

This pattern is often cleaner for this type of logic.
