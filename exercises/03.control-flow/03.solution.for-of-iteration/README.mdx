# For-Of Iteration

👨‍💼 Much cleaner! `for...of` is the preferred way to iterate over arrays in
modern TypeScript.

🦉 Benefits of `for...of`:

- No index management (no off-by-one errors!)
- TypeScript infers the element type automatically
- Works with any iterable (arrays, strings, Maps, Sets)
- Clearer intent—you're processing items, not indices

When you DO need the index, use `entries()`:

```ts
for (const [index, price] of prices.entries()) {
	console.log(`Item ${index}: $${price}`)
}
```

Later in this course, you'll learn about array methods like `reduce()` which can
make these calculations even more concise. But understanding loops is
fundamental—methods are built on top of them!
