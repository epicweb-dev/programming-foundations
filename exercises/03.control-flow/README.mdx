# Control Flow

Control flow is how programs make decisions and repeat work. Without it, code
would just run straight through from top to bottom.

## Conditionals

The `if` statement runs code only when a condition is true:

```ts
if (temperature > 30) {
	console.log("It's hot!")
}
```

Add `else` for an alternative:

```ts
if (temperature > 30) {
	console.log("It's hot!")
} else {
	console.log("It's comfortable")
}
```

Chain conditions with `else if`:

```ts
if (temperature > 30) {
	console.log("It's hot!")
} else if (temperature > 20) {
	console.log("It's warm")
} else {
	console.log("It's cool")
}
```

## Loops

Loops repeat code multiple times:

**`for` loop** - When you know how many times:

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
	console.log(i)
}
```

**`while` loop** - When you don't know how many times:

```ts
while (condition) {
	// Keep going until condition is false
}
```

**`for...of` loop** - For iterating over arrays (preferred!):

```ts
for (const item of items) {
	console.log(item)
}
```

<callout-info>
TypeScript's type narrowing works inside conditionals. When you check a type,
TypeScript knows the more specific type inside that block.

In this exercise, you'll use control flow to build real features.
