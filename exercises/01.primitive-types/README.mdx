# Primitive Types

Every program works with data, and TypeScript gives us **primitive types** to
represent the simplest forms of data: numbers, strings, and booleans.

```ts
const age: number = 25
const name: string = 'Alice'
const isActive: boolean = true
```

The core types you'll use most often:

- **`number`** - All numeric values (integers, decimals, negatives)
- **`string`** - Text data (always in quotes)
- **`boolean`** - True or false values
- **`null`** - Intentional absence of a value
- **`undefined`** - Variable not yet assigned
- **`bigint`** - Arbitrarily large integers
- **`symbol`** - Unique identifiers

## Why Types Matter

Without types, errors hide until your code runs:

```js
// JavaScript - no error until runtime
function double(x) {
	return x * 2
}
double('hello') // Returns NaN at runtime 😱
```

With TypeScript, you catch the mistake immediately:

```ts
function double(x: number): number {
	return x * 2
}
double('hello') // ❌ Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable
```

<callout-info>
	TypeScript's type annotations are like documentation that the compiler can
	verify. They tell other developers (and future you) exactly what kind of data
	your code expects.
</callout-info>

## Null and Undefined

TypeScript also has two special types for representing "absence of value":

- **`undefined`** - A variable that hasn't been assigned a value
- **`null`** - An intentional absence of any value

Understanding the difference helps you handle edge cases gracefully.

In this exercise, you'll work with these primitive types to build confidence in
TypeScript's type system.
