# Null and Undefined

👨‍💼 You've handled missing data safely! This is a crucial skill in real-world
applications.

🦉 The key insight is **narrowing**. When you check for `null` or `undefined`,
TypeScript knows the type is more specific inside that block:

```ts
let value: string | undefined

if (value !== undefined) {
	// TypeScript knows value is `string` here, not `string | undefined`
	console.log(value.toUpperCase()) // ✅ Safe!
}
```

This is one of TypeScript's superpowers—it tracks what you've checked and
updates its understanding of types accordingly.

In practice, many developers prefer `null` for intentional absence (like "user
hasn't set this yet") and let `undefined` represent truly missing values.
