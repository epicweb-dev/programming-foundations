# Null and Undefined

👨‍💼 Not every product has all fields filled in. We need to handle missing data
gracefully. This is where `null` and `undefined` come in.

The difference:

- **`undefined`** - The value hasn't been set (default for uninitialized
  variables)
- **`null`** - The value was intentionally set to "nothing"

```ts
let middleName: string | undefined // might not exist
const deletedAt: Date | null = null // intentionally empty
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a variable `discountCode` that can be `string` or `undefined`
2. Create a variable `lastPurchaseDate` that can be `string` or `null`, set to
   `null`
3. Check if `discountCode` has a value and log an appropriate message
4. Handle the case where `lastPurchaseDate` is `null`

💰 Use union types with the pipe `|`:

```ts
let value: string | null = null
```

💰 Check for null/undefined:

```ts
if (value !== undefined) {
	// value is definitely defined here
}
```
