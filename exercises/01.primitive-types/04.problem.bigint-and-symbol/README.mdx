# BigInt and Symbol

👨‍💼 TypeScript has two more primitive types that are less commonly used but good
to know about: `bigint` and `symbol`.

## BigInt - Large Integers

Regular `number` has limits—it can't accurately represent integers larger than
`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (about 9 quadrillion). `bigint` handles arbitrarily
large integers:

```ts
const big: bigint = 9007199254740993n // Note the 'n' suffix
const alsoBig: bigint = BigInt('9007199254740993')

// BigInt arithmetic
const sum = 1000000000000000000n + 1n // Works correctly!
```

<callout-warning>
	BigInt and number don't mix directly. You can't do `5n + 3`—you need to
	convert one type to the other.
</callout-warning>

## Symbol - Unique Identifiers

Symbols are guaranteed-unique values, useful as object keys when you need to
avoid name collisions:

```ts
const id: symbol = Symbol('userId')
const anotherId: symbol = Symbol('userId')

id === anotherId // false - each Symbol() creates a unique value!
```

Symbols are often used for "hidden" object properties or library-internal keys.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a bigint literal with the `n` suffix
2. Perform arithmetic with bigint values
3. Create symbols and observe their uniqueness

💰 BigInt syntax:

```ts
const big: bigint = 123456789012345678901234567890n
```
