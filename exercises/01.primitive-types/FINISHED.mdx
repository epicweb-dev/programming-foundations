# Primitive Types

👨‍💼 Excellent work! You now have a solid understanding of TypeScript's primitive
types.

You learned:

- 🔢 **Numbers** represent all numeric values in TypeScript
- 📝 **Strings** hold text data and support template literals
- ✅ **Booleans** are the foundation of conditional logic
- ❓ **Null and undefined** represent absence of value in different ways

🦉 A key insight: TypeScript's type inference often figures out types for you.
You don't always need to write `: number` or `: string`—TypeScript can infer
them from the values you assign.

```ts
const age = 25 // TypeScript knows this is a number
const name = 'Alice' // TypeScript knows this is a string
```

But explicit types are valuable when:

- You want to document your intent
- TypeScript can't infer the type (like function parameters)
- You're declaring a variable without an initial value
