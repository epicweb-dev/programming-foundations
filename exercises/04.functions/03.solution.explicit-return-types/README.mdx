# Explicit Return Types

👨‍💼 Excellent! Your functions now have clear contracts.

🦉 Notice how explicit return types make the function signature tell the whole
story:

```ts
function getFullName(firstName: string, lastName: string): string
function parseAge(ageString: string): number
function isValidEmail(email: string): boolean
```

Even without seeing the implementation, you know exactly what each function
expects and produces. This is invaluable in larger codebases where you might not
have time to read every function body.

In real projects, teams often have conventions about when to use explicit return
types. A common approach: explicit for exported functions, inference for
internal helpers.
