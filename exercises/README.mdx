# Programming Foundations 🧱

👨‍💼 Hello! I'm Peter the Product Manager, and I'm excited to guide you through
the foundations of TypeScript programming.

In this workshop, we'll explore **how values move through programs**. This is
the fundamental skill you need to write code that works reliably.

We'll cover:

1. **Expressions and Output** - Using `console.log()` to see results, working
   with strings and numbers
2. **Variables and Immutability** - Using `let` vs `const` and understanding
   when values can change
3. **Primitive Types** - Understanding type annotations for `number`, `string`,
   `boolean`, and the difference between `null` and `undefined`
4. **Control Flow** - Making decisions with `if`/`else` and repeating work with
   loops
5. **Functions** - Creating reusable pieces of code with typed parameters and
   returns
6. **Void and Never** - Understanding functions that don't return values or
   never return at all

	This workshop establishes the confidence you need to write code that compiles
	(actually runs). Every concept here forms the foundation for everything else
	you'll learn in TypeScript.

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

- Use `console.log()` to understand what your code is doing
- Declare variables with appropriate types
- Write functions with type-safe parameters and returns
- Use control flow to make decisions and iterate over data
- Understand how TypeScript helps catch errors before your code runs

Let's build something solid! 🏗️
