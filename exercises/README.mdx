# Typed Foundations 🧱

👨‍💼 Hello! I'm Peter the Product Manager, and I'm excited to guide you through
the foundations of TypeScript programming.

In this workshop, we'll explore **how values move through programs**. This is
the fundamental skill you need to write code that works reliably.

We'll cover:

1. **Primitive Types** - Understanding `number`, `string`, `boolean`, and the
   difference between `null` and `undefined`
2. **Variables and Immutability** - Using `let` vs `const` and understanding
   when values can change
3. **Control Flow** - Making decisions with `if`/`else` and repeating work with
   loops
4. **Functions** - Creating reusable pieces of code with typed parameters and
   returns
5. **Void and Never** - Understanding functions that don't return values or
   never return at all

This workshop establishes the confidence you need to write code that compiles.
Every concept here forms the foundation for everything else you'll learn in
TypeScript.
</callout-info>

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

- Declare variables with appropriate types
- Write functions with type-safe parameters and returns
- Use control flow to make decisions and iterate over data
- Understand how TypeScript helps catch errors before your code runs

Let's build something solid! 🏗️
