# Programming Foundations

👨‍💼 Congratulations! You've completed the Programming Foundations workshop! 🎉

You now understand how values flow through TypeScript programs:

- **Expressions and output** showed you how to see results with `console.log()`
  and work with strings and numbers
- **Variables** store values, and you know when to use `let` vs `const`
- **Primitive types** taught you how to add type annotations for extra safety
- **Control flow** lets your programs make decisions and repeat work
- **Functions** package up reusable logic with type-safe contracts
- **Void and never** help you understand functions that perform side effects or
  handle impossible states

📝 Take a moment to reflect on what you learned:

- What was the most surprising thing you discovered?
- How will you use these concepts in your own projects?
- What patterns will you adopt going forward?

🦉 **Key insight**: TypeScript's type system isn't about adding extra work—it's
about having a conversation with your future self (and teammates) about what
your code expects and produces.

## What's Next?

In the next workshop, **Working with Structured Data**, you'll learn to work
with objects, arrays, and more complex data structures. The primitives you
learned here will combine into powerful ways to model real-world data.

Keep coding! 🚀
