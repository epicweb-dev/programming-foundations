# Ternary Operator

👨‍💼 Sometimes you need to choose between two values based on a condition. The
`if`/`else` statement works, but it's verbose when you just need a simple
choice.

The **ternary operator** is a concise way to choose between two values:

```ts
const result = condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
```

It's called "ternary" because it has three parts:

1. The **condition** to check
2. The value if the condition is **true** (after `?`)
3. The value if the condition is **false** (after `:`)

Compare these equivalent approaches:

```ts
// Using if/else (5 lines)
let status: string
if (age >= 18) {
	status = 'adult'
} else {
	status = 'minor'
}

// Using ternary (1 line)
const status = age >= 18 ? 'adult' : 'minor'
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and use the ternary operator to:

1. Create `weatherDescription` - "hot" if temperature > 30, otherwise
   "comfortable"
2. Create `passed` - true if score >= 70, otherwise false
3. Create `stockMessage` - "In stock" if stock > 0, otherwise "Out of stock"

<callout-info>
	The ternary operator is an **expression** that produces a value, while
	`if`/`else` is a **statement** that executes code. This means you can use
	ternaries anywhere you need a value—in variable assignments, function
	arguments, or template literals.
