# Loops

👨‍💼 Great job! You used loops to build a string step by step—a very common
pattern when generating output.

🦉 The string-building pattern:

1. Start with an empty string
2. Build one piece at a time
3. Add separators like `\n` between pieces

This pattern shows up when generating reports, formatting text, or building
simple ASCII art.
