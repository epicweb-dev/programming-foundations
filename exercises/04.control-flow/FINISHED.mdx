# Control Flow

👨‍💼 Excellent! You now know how to make programs that think and repeat.

You learned:

- 🔀 **`if`/`else`** for making decisions
- 🔁 **`for` loops** for counted repetition
- 🔄 **`while` loops** for conditional repetition
- 📦 **`for...of`** for iterating over collections (the cleanest option!)

🦉 A best practice: Prefer `for...of` over traditional `for` loops when working
with arrays. It's cleaner, harder to mess up, and TypeScript gives you better
type inference.

```ts
// ✅ Preferred
for (const item of items) {
	process(item)
}

// 😐 Works but more error-prone
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
	process(items[i])
}
```
