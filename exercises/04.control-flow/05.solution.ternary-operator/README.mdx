# Ternary Operator

👨‍💼 Nice work! The ternary operator is one of the most useful tools for writing
concise code.

🦉 Notice that `passed` could be simplified even further:

```ts
// This works but is redundant:
const passed = score >= 70 ? true : false

// The comparison already produces a boolean!
const passed = score >= 70
```

When your ternary returns `true` or `false` based on a condition, you often
don't need the ternary at all—the condition itself is already a boolean.

However, ternaries shine when you need to choose between **non-boolean values**
like strings, numbers, or objects based on a condition.
