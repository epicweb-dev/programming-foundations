# Loops

👨‍💼 Great job! You've used the accumulator pattern—one of the most common loop
patterns in programming.

🦉 The accumulator pattern:

1. Start with an initial value (`total = 0`)
2. Loop through items
3. Update the accumulator each iteration
4. Use the final value after the loop

This pattern appears everywhere: calculating totals, counting matches, building
strings, and more.

In the next step, we'll see a cleaner way to iterate with `for...of`.
