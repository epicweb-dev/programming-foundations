👨‍💼 We're building a grade calculator for a school system. Based on a numeric
score, we need to determine the letter grade.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Write an `if`/`else if`/`else` chain to determine the letter grade:
   - 90 and above: "A"
   - 80-89: "B"
   - 70-79: "C"
   - 60-69: "D"
   - Below 60: "F"

2. Add a check to see if the student passed (grade C or above)

💰 Check ranges with comparisons:

```ts
if (score >= 90) {
	// A
} else if (score >= 80) {
	// B (we know score < 90 because first check failed)
}
```
