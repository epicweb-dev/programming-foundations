# Loops

👨‍💼 We need to calculate the total price of items in a shopping cart. This is a
classic use case for loops—processing each item in a collection.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Use a `for` loop to iterate through the prices array
2. Add each price to a running total
3. Count how many items cost more than $10

💰 Traditional `for` loop structure:

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
	const item = array[i]
	// do something with item
}
```

💰 Accumulator pattern:

```ts
let total = 0
for (...) {
  total = total + value
  // or: total += value
}
```
