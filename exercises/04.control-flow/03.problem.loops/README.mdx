# Loops

👨‍💼 Let's build a fun text banner using loops. We'll make a simple "staircase"
pattern of `*` characters.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Use a `for` loop to build 5 rows of stars
2. Each row should have one more `*` than the previous row
3. Put each row on its own line using `\n`

💰 Traditional `for` loop structure:

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
	// do something
}
```

💰 String building with a loop:

```ts
let output = ''
for (...) {
	output += 'x'
}
```

💰 You'll need **two loops** for this exercise—an outer loop for each row, and
an inner loop to build the stars for that row. This is called a "nested loop":

```ts
for (let row = 1; row <= 5; row++) {
	// inner loop builds stars for this row
	for (let star = 0; star < row; star++) {
		// add a star
	}
}
```
