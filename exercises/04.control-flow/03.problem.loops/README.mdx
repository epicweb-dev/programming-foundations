# Loops

👨‍💼 Let's practice a simple `for` loop by building a numbered list.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and use a `for` loop to build a string
with labels for exhibits 1 through 5. Each label should be on its own line.

## How a `for` loop works

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
	// repeat work
}
```

Each part of the loop has a job:

- **Initializer** (`let i = 0`) runs once before the loop starts
- **Condition** (`i < limit`) is checked before each iteration
- **Final expression** (`i++`) runs after each iteration

`i++` means "add 1 to `i`." It's the same as `i += 1`.
