# Loops

👨‍💼 Let's build a fun text banner using loops. We'll make a simple "staircase"
pattern of `*` characters.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Use a `for` loop to build 5 rows of stars
2. Each row should have one more `*` than the previous row
3. Put each row on its own line using `\n`

💰 Traditional `for` loop structure:

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
	// do something
}
```

💰 String building with a loop:

```ts
let output = ''
for (...) {
	output += 'x'
}
```

🐨 Once you've completed the exercise, run `node index.ts` in the playground to test your work!
