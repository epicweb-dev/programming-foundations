# Nested Loops

👨‍💼 Let's generate a seating chart for a small theater. Each row has multiple
seats, so we'll need a loop inside a loop.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and build a string that looks like this:

```
A1 A2 A3 A4
B1 B2 B3 B4
C1 C2 C3 C4
```

Each row should be on its own line using `\n`.

Use **nested `for` loops**:

- The **outer loop** controls which row you're on
- The **inner loop** builds the seat labels for that row
