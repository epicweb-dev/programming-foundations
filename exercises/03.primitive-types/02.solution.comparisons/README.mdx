# Comparisons

👨‍💼 Great work! You've seen the critical difference between loose and strict
equality.

🦉 The key takeaway: **always use `===` and `!==`** in your code. Loose equality
(`==` and `!=`) can lead to confusing bugs because of its type coercion rules.

For example, these are all true with loose equality:

```ts
'' == false // true
0 == '' // true
null == undefined // true
```

With strict equality, different types are never equal, which is almost always
what you want.

TypeScript actually helps here—if you try to compare incompatible types with
`===`, TypeScript will warn you that the comparison will always be false!
