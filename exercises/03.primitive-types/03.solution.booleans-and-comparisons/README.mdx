# Booleans and Comparisons

👨‍💼 Great work! You've seen how booleans power decision-making in programs.

🦉 Notice that TypeScript inferred the boolean type from our comparisons:

```ts
const hasDiscount = price < 50 // TypeScript infers: boolean
```

This is a common pattern—you'll create booleans from comparisons more often than
assigning `true` or `false` directly.

The logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) are essential for combining conditions.
We'll use them extensively when we cover control flow.
