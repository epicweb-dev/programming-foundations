# Null and Undefined

👨‍💼 Not every product has all fields filled in. We need to handle missing data
gracefully. This is where `null` and `undefined` come in.

The difference:

- **`undefined`** - The value hasn't been set (default for uninitialized
  variables)
- **`null`** - The value was intentionally set to "nothing"

```ts
let middleName = undefined // not set yet
const deletedAt = null // intentionally empty
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a variable `discountCode` set to `undefined`
2. Create a variable `lastPurchaseDate` set to `null`
3. Log both variables to see their values
