# Booleans and Logical Operators

👨‍💼 Our product catalog needs to track whether items are available and combine
multiple conditions. Booleans and logical operators are essential for making
decisions in code.

You've already learned that comparisons return booleans. Now let's work with
boolean values directly and combine them with **logical operators**.

## Logical Operators

```ts
const both = a && b // true if BOTH are true
const either = a || b // true if EITHER is true
const opposite = !a // inverts the boolean
```

Use parentheses to group expressions and control order of operations:

```ts
const result1 = (a && b) || c // && happens first, then ||
const result2 = a && (b || c) // || happens first, then &&
const result3 = (a || b) && c // || happens first, then &&
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and complete the following tasks:

1. Create a variable `isAvailable` with type `boolean` set to `true`
2. Create a variable `isOnSale` with type `boolean` set to `false`
3. Create a variable `hasDiscount` that's `true` when the price is under 50
4. Create a variable `canPurchase` that's `true` when the item is available AND
   in stock
5. Create a variable `isNotAvailable` that's the opposite of `isAvailable` using
   the `!` operator

	You'll notice `// @ts-expect-error` comments in the code. This tells
	TypeScript to ignore the type error on the next line. Once you've created the
	variables (`isAvailable`, `isOnSale`, `hasDiscount`, `canPurchase`,
	`isNotAvailable`), you can remove these comments and the code will work
	correctly!
