# Booleans and Comparisons

👨‍💼 Our product catalog needs to track whether items are available and compare
prices. Booleans are essential for making decisions in code.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and complete the following tasks:

1. Create a variable `isAvailable` with type `boolean` set to `true`
2. Create a variable `isOnSale` with type `boolean` set to `false`
3. Create a variable `hasDiscount` that's `true` when the price is under 50
4. Create a variable `canPurchase` that's `true` when the item is available AND
   in stock

💰 Comparison operators return booleans:

```ts
const isExpensive = price > 100 // boolean
const isMatch = name === 'test' // boolean
```

💰 Logical operators combine booleans:

```ts
const both = a && b // true if BOTH are true
const either = a || b // true if EITHER is true
const opposite = !a // inverts the boolean
```
