# BigInt and Symbol

👨‍💼 Nice work! You now know all of TypeScript's primitive types.

🦉 When to use these types:

**BigInt:**

- Financial calculations requiring precision beyond `number`
- Cryptographic operations
- Working with database IDs that exceed safe integer limits
- Any math requiring very large integers

**Symbol:**

- Creating unique object keys that won't collide with string keys
- Library-internal properties that shouldn't be accessed directly
- Well-known symbols like `Symbol.iterator` for custom iteration

In practice, `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, and `undefined` cover 99% of
use cases. But it's good to know `bigint` and `symbol` exist when you need them!

```ts
// The complete set of TypeScript primitives:
const str: string = 'hello'
const num: number = 42
const bool: boolean = true
const nul: null = null
const undef: undefined = undefined
const big: bigint = 9007199254740993n
const sym: symbol = Symbol('unique')
```
