# Null and Undefined

👨‍💼 You've handled missing data safely! This is a crucial skill in real-world
applications.

🦉 The key insight: `null` and `undefined` represent two different kinds of
"missing" values. You can check for each directly to decide what to do.

```ts
const value = undefined

if (value === undefined) {
	console.log('Missing value')
}
```

In practice, many developers prefer `null` for intentional absence (like "user
hasn't set this yet") and let `undefined` represent truly missing values.
