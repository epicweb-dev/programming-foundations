# Null and Undefined

👨‍💼 Not every product has all fields filled in. We need to handle missing data
gracefully. This is where `null` and `undefined` come in.

The difference:

- **`undefined`** - The value hasn't been set (default for uninitialized
  variables)
- **`null`** - The value was intentionally set to "nothing"

```ts
let middleName = undefined // not set yet
const deletedAt = null // intentionally empty
```

## Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a concise way to choose between two values based on a
condition:

```ts
const result = condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a variable `discountCode` set to `undefined`
2. Create a variable `lastPurchaseDate` set to `null`
3. Use the ternary operator to log whether `discountCode` has a value
4. Use the ternary operator to handle `lastPurchaseDate` being `null`

💰 Check for null/undefined with ternary:

```ts
console.log(value !== undefined ? 'Has value: ' + value : 'No value')
```
