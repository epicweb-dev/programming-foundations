# Comparisons

👨‍💼 Our product system needs to compare values—prices, quantities, and more.
Understanding comparison operators is essential for making decisions in code.

## Equality Operators

JavaScript has two types of equality:

**Loose equality (`==`)** - Compares values after type conversion:

```ts
100 == '100' // true (string converted to number)
0 == false // true (false converted to 0)
```

**Strict equality (`===`)** - Compares values AND types:

```ts
100 === '100' // false (number vs string)
0 === false // false (number vs boolean)
```

<callout-warning>
	Always prefer `===` and `!==` (strict equality). Loose equality's type
	conversion can cause subtle bugs that are hard to track down.
</callout-warning>

## Inequality Operators

The same distinction applies to "not equal":

- `!=` - Loose inequality (with type conversion)
- `!==` - Strict inequality (no type conversion)

## Relational Operators

These compare order/magnitude:

```ts
a > b // greater than
a < b // less than
a >= b // greater than or equal
a <= b // less than or equal
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Compare `price` (number) and `quantity` (string) with both `==` and `===`
2. Use `!=` and `!==` to check if `a` is not equal to `b`
3. Use `>` and `<=` to compare `a` and `b`
