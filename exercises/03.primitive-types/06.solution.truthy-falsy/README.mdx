# Truthy and Falsy

👨‍💼 Nice work! You just used truthy and falsy values to build boolean logic
without writing explicit comparisons.

🦉 Remember: a boolean can be created from **any** value:

```ts
const isPresent = Boolean(value)
const alsoBoolean = !!value
```

This is useful when you care about "has a value" rather than the specific
value. We'll rely on this pattern a lot when we get into control flow.
