# Explicit Return Types

👨‍💼 Excellent! Your functions now have clear contracts.

🦉 Notice how explicit return types make the function signature tell the whole
story:

```ts
function getFullName(firstName: string, lastName: string): string
function parseAge(ageString: string): number
function isValidEmail(email: string): boolean
```

Even without seeing the implementation, you know exactly what each function
expects and produces. This is invaluable in larger codebases where you might not
have time to read every function body.

## When to use inference instead

Many teams prefer letting TypeScript infer return types wherever possible:

```ts
function getFullName(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
	return `${firstName} ${lastName}` // TypeScript infers: string
}
```

This reduces redundancy since TypeScript already knows the return type from the
implementation. Explicit return types are most valuable when:

- The function is part of a public API boundary
- You want to catch implementation mistakes early
- The inferred type would be too wide (e.g., `string | number` when you want
  just `string`)
- State machine functions that must return valid states
