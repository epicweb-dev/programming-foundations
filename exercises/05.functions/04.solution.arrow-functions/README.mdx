# Arrow Functions

👨‍💼 Great work! You've learned when and how to use arrow functions.

🦉 Key takeaways:

1. **Implicit returns** work when the function body is a single expression—no
   braces, no `return` keyword needed
2. **Arrow functions are perfect for callbacks** because they're concise and
   don't rebind `this` (we'll learn about `this` later)
3. **Function declarations** are still best for top-level named functions
   because of hoisting and clearer stack traces

```ts
// Use arrow functions for callbacks
function applyToNumber(
	value: number,
	transform: (n: number) => number,
): number {
	return transform(value)
}

const result = applyToNumber(5, (n) => n + 1)

// Use function declarations for top-level functions
function processOrder(order: Order): Receipt {
	// ...
}
```
