# Parameters and Return Values

👨‍💼 Perfect! You've created reusable, type-safe utility functions.

🦉 Notice how the type annotations serve as documentation:

```ts
function applyDiscount(price: number, discountPercent: number): number
```

Just from reading this signature, you know:

- It takes a price and a percentage
- It returns a number (presumably the discounted price)
- You can't accidentally pass a string

This is the power of TypeScript—self-documenting code that catches mistakes at
compile time, not runtime.
