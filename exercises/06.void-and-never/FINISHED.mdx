# Void and Never

👨‍💼 Excellent work! You now understand two important return types.

You learned:

- 🚫 **`void`** - Function performs a side effect, returns nothing
- ⛔ **`never`** - Function never returns (throws or loops forever)
- 🔍 **Exhaustiveness checking** - Using `never` to ensure all cases are handled

🦉 Key insight: These types communicate **intent**.

- `void` says "I do something, but don't expect a value back"
- `never` says "I won't return—ever"

This is especially powerful for error handling functions:

```ts
function fail(message: string): never {
	throw new Error(message)
}

function process(data: string | null): string {
	if (data === null) {
		fail('Data cannot be null') // TypeScript knows we won't continue
	}
	return data.toUpperCase() // TypeScript knows data is string here
}
```

🎉 Congratulations! You've completed the Programming Foundations workshop. You have
the essential skills to write TypeScript code that compiles and communicates its
intent clearly.
