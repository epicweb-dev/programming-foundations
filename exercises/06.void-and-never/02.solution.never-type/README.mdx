# The Never Type

👨‍💼 You've learned how `never` works in functions that always throw.

🦉 A `never` return type is perfect for helpers like `throwError`. It tells
TypeScript (and other readers) that the function does not return normally:

```ts
function throwError(message: string): never {
	throw new Error(message)
}
```

This makes it clear that execution stops on that path, which helps keep your
code safe and predictable.
