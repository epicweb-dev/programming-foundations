## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with JavaScript syntax
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Curiosity and willingness to learn!

## Pre-workshop Resources

Here are some resources you can read before taking the workshop to get you up to
speed on some of the tools and concepts we'll be covering:

- [TypeScript Handbook - The Basics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html)
- [JavaScript.info - Data Types](https://javascript.info/types)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.18 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v20 or greater
- [npm][npm] v8 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

Use the Epic Workshop CLI to get this setup:

```sh nonumber
npx --yes epicshop@latest add programming-foundations
```

If you experience errors here, please open [an issue][issue] with as many
details as you can offer.

## The Workshop App

Learn all about the workshop app on the
[Epic Web Getting Started Guide](https://www.epicweb.dev/get-started).
