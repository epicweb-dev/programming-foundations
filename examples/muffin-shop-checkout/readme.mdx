# Muffin Shop Checkout

👨‍💼 The muffin shop needs a simple receipt that totals an order and prints a
clean summary for customers.

📜 This example sticks to the skills from the workshop: numbers, strings,
booleans, variables, functions, if/else, switch statements, and loops.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and complete the following tasks:

1. Build the divider string with a loop.
2. Calculate `subtotal`.
3. Implement `calculateDiscount`.
4. Implement `calculateTax`.
5. Implement `calculateTip`.
6. Implement `calculatePickupFee` with a switch statement.
7. Set `pickupLabel` with an if/else.
8. Set `memberMessage` with an if/else.
9. Calculate `total`.
10. Make sure the receipt prints with `console.log`.

💰 Flip `isMember` to see the discount and message change.
💰 Try `pickupMethod` as `curbside` or `delivery` to test the switch logic.

## Run the example

```sh nonumber
npm run start --workspace examples/muffin-shop-checkout
```

## Try next

- 🐨 Add a `dailySpecialCount` and `dailySpecialPrice`, then include them in the
  `subtotal`.
- 🐨 Create a `hasCoupon` boolean and apply an extra discount with an `if` check.
- 🐨 Use a loop to build a `summaryLine` like `Items: 5 total`.
- 🐨 Add a `rushOrder` flag that increases the `tipPercent` when true.
- 💰 Try a new `pickupMethod` value and update the switch to handle it.
