# Coffee Cart Checkout

👨‍💼 The coffee cart is selling drinks at a community event. You need a simple
receipt that totals an order and prints a clean summary for customers.

📜 This example sticks to the skills from the workshop: numbers, strings,
booleans, variables, functions, if/else, switch statements, and loops.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and complete the following tasks:

1. Build the divider string with a loop.
2. Calculate `subtotal`.
3. Implement `calculateDiscount`.
4. Implement `calculateTax`.
5. Implement `calculateTip`.
6. Implement `calculateShipping` with a switch statement.
7. Set `shippingLabel` with an if/else.
8. Set `memberMessage` with an if/else.
9. Calculate `total`.
10. Make sure the receipt prints with `console.log`.

💰 Flip `isMember` to see the discount and message change.
💰 Try `shippingSpeed` as `pickup` or `express` to test the switch logic.

## Run the example

```sh nonumber
npm run start --workspace examples/coffee-cart-checkout
```
