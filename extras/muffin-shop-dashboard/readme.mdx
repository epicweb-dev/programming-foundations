# Muffin Shop Dashboard

👨‍💼 The muffin shop wants a simple dashboard for a single order so the team can
double-check totals before handing it off.

📜 This example uses React + Vite, but everything React-related is already done
for you. You only need the workshop skills: numbers, strings, booleans,
variables, functions, if/else, switch statements, loops, and `never`.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="src/muffin-utils.ts" /> and complete the following tasks:

1. Format money with a template literal.
2. Add the `(GF)` label for gluten-free items.
3. Sum the subtotal with a loop.
4. Apply the member discount.
5. Calculate tax and tip.
6. Calculate the final total.
7. Return the pickup fee with a switch statement.
8. Return the pickup label with a switch statement.
9. Format the special note when it's empty.
10. Log the ready message.
11. Implement `assertNever`.

💰 Toggle `memberStatus` or `pickupMethod` in <InlineFile file="src/app.tsx" /> to
see different outputs.

## Run the example

```sh nonumber
npm run dev --workspace examples/muffin-shop-dashboard
```

## Try next

- 🐨 Add another `OrderItem` and watch the totals change.
- 🐨 Add a `rushOrder` boolean and increase the tip when it is true.
- 🐨 Add a `itemCount` helper that uses a loop to count total quantity.
- 🐨 Add a `happyHour` boolean and reduce the muffin price when true.
- 🐨 Add a `memberMessage` string in `app.tsx` using an `if` check.
- 💰 Change `specialNote` to a real note and confirm the fallback logic.
